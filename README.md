Testing Approach:

Automated Testing: Utilized Postman for automated API testing to ensure the reliability and efficiency of CRUD operations.
Data Validation: Ensured accurate data handling and validation at each step of the testing process.
Reports Verification: Thoroughly verified the accuracy and completeness of reports generated by the API.
